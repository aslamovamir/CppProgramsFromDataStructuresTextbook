A program that converts an algebraic expression to either post-fix or pre-fix notation, and can equally convert either post-fix or pre-fix notation to any other.
The program is developed on higher-order abstract data structures, object-oriented design, and complex data structures such as linked lists, deques and stacks, 
highly effective structures in terms of performance.
