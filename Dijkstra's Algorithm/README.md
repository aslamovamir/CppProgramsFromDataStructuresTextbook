Implementation of Dijkestra'sAlgorithm to fins the shortest path from a particular vertex to any other in the grapgh data structure.
The project involves the use of adjacencly list data structures implemented with a vector of linked lists, nodes, stacks and vector 
of map entrees and maps, highly effective data structures in terms of performance.
